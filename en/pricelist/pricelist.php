                Photo retouching is a complex process. Depending on your goals,
                the price may vary. The minimum price for editing one photo is
                1000 rubles.

            Record on prepayment 1000₽.<br><br>

            The date is not considered booked until the prepayment is made.<br>
            The Deposit is non-refundable and is valid for a month. You can
            change the shooting date not later than three days before shooting.<br>
            If shooting was planned to be on the street and on the eve of
            shooting, according to the forecast, the weather worsens, we
            transfer it to another convenient date (or place) without loss of
            payment.<br><br>

            I help to pose and to choose locations as it is my direct duty.<br><br>

            I select photos for retouching myself.<br><br>

            I do not give the original pictures, as it is a “draft”, but if
            you really want to get them, it can be done for a fee of 500 rubles
            (the pictures can be obtained only for a week from the day of shooting).<br><br>

            Also, if you want your photo shoot to remain confidential, please let
            me know in advance. If there was no such agreement, I can use your
            photos in my social networks and replenish my portfolio.<br><br>

            Individual shooting can take place both on the street and in the Studio.
            The Studio is booked and paid separately. I prefer to shoot in good proven
            studios, because the result is very important to me. A list of recommended
            studios can be found <a href="/en/pricelist/studio/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            If you want to shoot in another Studio, this is discussed separately.
